# Wi-Fi-Attack-Automation-using-ESP8266

# üìñ Project Description

This project explores the vulnerabilities in wireless networks by automating common Wi-Fi attacks using the ESP8266 microcontroller. These attacks include:

- Deauthentication Attack: A denial-of-service (DoS) attack that sends forged deauthentication packets to disconnect users from Wi-Fi networks, exploiting the unencrypted nature of 802.11 deauth frames.

- Beacon Flooding: The ESP8266 sends thousands of fake SSIDs to flood the surrounding area with illegitimate networks, potentially confusing users or overloading devices.

- Evil Twin Attack: A fake access point (AP) is created that mimics a legitimate Wi-Fi network to trick users into connecting, enabling Man-in-the-Middle (MITM) attacks.

Using libraries like ESP8266 Deauther, these attacks are implemented with a web interface or via direct packet crafting. The project emphasizes the ease of executing wireless attacks and the importance of Wi-Fi security protocols like WPA2/3, MAC filtering, and intrusion detection systems.
